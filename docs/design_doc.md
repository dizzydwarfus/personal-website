  - Interactive constellation map set against a dark, starry background.
  - Each "star" represents core values, professional milestones, skills, projects, and personal interests.

- **Interactive Exploration:**
  - Hovering over stars reveals concise titles and brief introductions.
  - Clicking stars opens detailed modal views, displaying deeper narratives and content.
  - Connective lines visually illustrate relationships between various elements.

#### Core Values (Central Star Cluster)

- Prominently placed constellation highlighting your core principles:
  - **Continuous Learning**
  - **Ownership**
  - **Resilience**
  - **Curiosity**
  - **Empathy**
- Clicking each principle star reveals detailed explanations and relevant personal stories/examples.

#### Professional Experience and Projects (Orbiting Stars)

- Professional milestones orbiting around your core values:
  - Detailed timeline upon interaction, highlighting roles, projects, and impacts.
  - Direct links to detailed resume and project pages.

### Resume Page

  - Subtle, fluid Framer Motion animations for stars and interactions.
  - Smooth transitions between views.
